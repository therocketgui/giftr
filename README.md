# Giftr

Amazon meets Pinterest meets Instagram. Giftr allows you to create gift boards browsing the Amazon product API in a very simple and clean way. You can share with friends, collaborate on boards and, comment and like items. 

The problems I'm trying to solve are:

- I'm shit at finding gifts, especially at Christmas. If I can keep a wish list of all my family members, it would be "da bomb"!
- Amazon is not funny to browse, there is too much distraction and information.

Every link is affiliate, I'll earn a commission on every purchase through the app.

## Introduction ##
-------------

I'm building this app as I started learning Ruby On Rails few weeks ago. I want to build it from scratch to deployement, push traffic on it and acquire users. Then I'll be confident I learned Ruby On Rails the hard way!

I built it to be heavily social and integrated a referral mechanism on it to bootstrap virality straight away.

Enjoy :)

Note: The design is really inspired by Pinterest at the moment, I'll quickly move away from it.
